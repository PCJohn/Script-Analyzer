'''
This module reads scripts for the actual analysis. It provides methods for character importance analysis with the following:
(1) Graph of all characters in the graph
(2) Subgraph of (1) with only the main characters
(3) The time-vs-centrality plot of the main characters

Usage:      import script_reader as sr
            reader = sr.Reader()
       The character interaction graph of all characters and the main characters can be seen with-
    
           reader.show_all_and_main_char("path_to_script",F,centrality_type)
        
       The main characters are the nodes whose centrality is more than F*(mean centrality of all nodes)
       The centrality-vs-time graph of all the main characters can be seen with-
           
           reader.centrality_trace(script,centrality_type)

       centrality_type should a string with the name of the centrality measure to be used. All accepted values of centrality type are listed in the README
